# JavaScript Global Memory (Variable Environment)

In JavaScript, the global memory (also known as the Variable Environment) is a key component for storing and managing variables and functions in the global scope. It plays a critical role in understanding how variables are accessible throughout your entire JavaScript program.

## Global Memory Components

### 1. Variables

Global memory stores variables declared with `var`, `let`, or `const` at the global scope. These variables are accessible from anywhere in your code.

### 2. Function Declarations

Function declarations at the global level are also stored in global memory. These functions can be invoked from anywhere in your program.

### 3. Global Object

In a browser environment, the global memory includes the global object (`window` in the browser). It serves as the outermost container for global variables and functions. You can access global variables and functions as properties of the global object.

## Global Variables and Scope

Variables declared in the global scope are accessible throughout your entire JavaScript program. They have global scope and can be accessed from any part of your code.

## Example

```javascript
// Variables declared at the global scope
const globalVar = 'I am global';

function globalFunction() {
    console.log(globalVar); // Accessing globalVar
}

globalFunction(); // Invoking globalFunction
```

## Sequence

In this example:

-   globalVar is declared in the global scope and can be accessed both inside and outside functions.
-   globalFunction is defined globally and can be invoked from anywhere in the program.

## Conclusion

Understanding the global memory and its role in storing variables and functions at the global scope is essential for effective JavaScript programming.
